- 👋 Hi, I’m @AtelierFox
- 👀 I’m interested in Functional Programming, Category Theory, Game Engines, FPGAs & Reprogrammable Hardware
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Haskell, Scala 3
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on FPGA Projects, Engines, or other functional programming projects.
- I'm currently working on a functional type-safe game engine based on John Carmack's QuakeCon 2013 talk. Still in very early prototype stages.
  - Used to be in Haskell, but progress has slowed due to the abstraction being extremely unwieldy, and higher-kinded type errors being arcane.
  - Scala 3 currently looks promising for porting data over.
  - Also contemplating using an FFI and separating world simulation from interaction with the user for seperation of concerns reasons.
